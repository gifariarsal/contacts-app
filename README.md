# Counter App with Modified FizzBuzz Logic

## Overview

This is a simple Counter App that displays a count value with a modified FizzBuzz logic. The app is built using React and Vite.

## Modified FizzBuzz Logic

The FizzBuzz logic in this app is applied to the count value with a slight modification:

- If the count is 0, it displays the count value.
- If the count is divisible by 3, it displays "Fizz".
- If the count is divisible by 5, it displays "Buzz".
- If the count is divisible by both 3 and 5, it displays "FizzBuzz".

Feel free to customize and enhance the app according to your needs!
